To do (& notes):

10/6/14
Take maxvol_ebay and maxvol_sbay out of roimpact menu (these items must be altered by admin).

These items are entered by the consultant:
	days per week
	hours per day
	quantity of bays
	# express bays selected
	
*Remember to add warning functionality =>
	if an express bay is at at least 80% capacity, warning needs to go up that says "You may want to consider adding another bay."
	if an express by is at 100% capacity, you need a warning that says "You need to add another bay."
